# Pwrtelegram API

## PWRTelegram was deprecated and superseded by [MadelineProto](https://github.com/danog/MadelineProto).  
## If you want to use an HTTP API for interacting with MadelineProto, I highly recommend [TelegramApiServer](https://github.com/xtrime-ru/TelegramApiServer).

## Thank you for using PWRTelegram.

Version 2.   
Licensed under AGPLv3.  

[API status](https://status.pwrtelegram.xyz)

This repository contains the source code for the pwrtelegram API, a boosted version of the official telegram bot API.

The PWRTelegram API makes use of:  

* The [Caddy](https://github.com/mholt/caddy) web server.
* PHP 7
* [php-mediainfo](https://github.com/mhor/php-mediainfo)
* AN AWESOME+++ PHP MTProto client called [MadelineProto](https://github.com/danog/MadelineProto)
* A modified version of [proxy.php](https://github.com/mcnemesis/proxy.php)
* [telegram-lua-load](https://github.com/pwrtelegram/telegram-lua-load)

This API is written and maintained by [danog](https://github.com/danog) ([@danogentili on telegram](https://telegram.me/danogentili)) with the help of the folks over [@BotDevelopment](https://telegram.me/BotDevelopment), especially [itskenny0](https://github.com/itskenny0) ([@shitposting on telegram](https://telegram.me/shitposting)) and [Rondoozle](https://github.com/Rondoozle) ([@POTUS on Telegram](https://telegram.me/POTUS)).  

It is hosted by Botstack.

The new PWRTelegram logo was created by [@BayernPars](https://telegram.me/BayernPars).

* [You tell me!](https://telegram.me/pwrtelegramgroup)  


## How do I enable it?  

To enable it simply substitute the URL of the bot telegram API (https://api.telegram.org) with the URL of the pwrtelegram API (https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz for normal bots and https://deepapi.pwrtelegram.xyz for deep telegram bots) in your telegram client.

You can use one of the following commands to do it:

```
sed -i 's/api\.telegram\.org/api\.pwrtelegram\.xyz/g' client.py
# OR
sed -i 's/api\.telegram\.org/deepapi\.pwrtelegram\.xyz/g' client.py
```  

The client can be written in any language, not necessarily python.

Or you can manually substitute ```api.telegram.org``` with ```api.pwrtelegram.xyz``` or ```deepapi.pwrtelegram.xyz``` in your bot,

If you use webhooks you must recall the setwebhook method.  

Then, if you intend to use the API to download/upload files, you must set a custom backend (scroll down to see how to do that).  

The API will automagically do the rest :)  

Also please insert the following text in the response to the /start command:  
```
This bot makes use of the @pwrtelegram bot API to enhance its features.
```


## How do I use it?

Just use it as you would use the official telegram bot API, only bear in the following points.

* Please do not abuse of the API by uploading and/or downloading illegal or copyrighted material. The pwrtelegram API creator reserves the right to delete any illegal or copyrighted material that is found on his servers.  

* The PWRTelegram API does not store in any way your bot's token but it does store the bot's username, the sha256 sum of uploaded files and the file ID and the size of uploaded and downloaded files.

* This API won't be able to send big files if getUpdate or webhook requests aren't proxied through it. This is because when the API uploads these files using MadelineProto it must obtain a file_id using the official bot API, and that can be done only by intercepting the incoming update with the file.

* The methods used by the PWRTelegram API are the same ones used in the official telegram bot API, but they also have some additional features and in certain cases their behaviour is slightly modified (don't worry, that won't break your clients). There are also some methods that work only with the PWRTelegram API. Here's a list:

* With this API you can use usernames to interact even with normal users and you can get info about bots using their username (with the getChat method).  

* Do not send more than 50 different files (as in files with different sha256sums) without processing updates. Once reached this limit, files will not be sent if there's an unprocessed message from a user that isn't @pwrtelegramapi in front of the message queue (this limitation is only present if you use getupdates).  


### Logging in as a normal user

To login using a phone number, call the phonelogin method while passing the phone number as the phone parameter:

```
https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/phonelogin?phone=+3984748839
```

On success, a temporary access token will be returned:

```
{"ok": true, "result": "hjJhh-_3838rhehhH2"}
```

Use it to call the completephonelogin method with the code you received.

```
https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/userhjJhh-_3838rhehhH2/completephonelogin?code=77486
```

On success, the permanent access token will be returned:

```
{"ok": true, "result": "101384885:hjJhh-_3838rhehhH2"}
```

If 2FA is enabled, the following json will be returned:
```
{"ok": false, "error_code": 401, "description": "2FA is enabled: call the complete2FALogin method with the password as password parameter (hint: urhint)"}
```

In this case you must complete login by calling the complete2FALogin method:

```
https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/userhjJhh-_3838rhehhH2/complete2FALogin?password=password
```

If the number you used doesn't have a telegram account, the following json will be returned:
```
{"ok": false, "error_code": 401, "description": "Need to sign up: call the completesignup method"}
```

In this case you must complete login by calling the completesignup method (last_name is optional):

```
https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/userhjJhh-_3838rhehhH2/completesignup?first_name=Urlencoded%20first%20name&last_name=last%20name
```

On success, the permanent access token will be returned:

```
{"ok": true, "result": "101384885:hjJhh-_3838rhehhH2"}
```

If you get a lot of flood wait errors while uploading/downloading files using a normal bot, you can set a custom backend for that bot:

```
https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/botTOKEN/setbackend?backend_token=101384885:hjJhh-_3838rhehhH2
```

To call methods as a logged in user use the following url (params can be passed using GET and POST, arrays must be encoded using json):

```
https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz/user101384885:hjJhh-_3838rhehhH2/method?param=value
```

The methods that can be called using the user access token are the following (see https://daniil.it/MadelineProto for more info):

* upload - Uploads the file uploaded using POST as the `file` parameter to telegram, returns an [InputFile](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/types/InputFile.html) object that must be used to generate an [InputMedia](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/types/InputMedia.html) object, that can be later sent using the [sendmedia method](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/methods/messages_sendMedia.html).

* enableGetupdates - Enables storing updates and fetching using getUpdates

* disableGetupdates - Disables storing updates and fetching using getUpdates, you MUST call this method if you only want to use the user as a backend

* setWebHook - Like in the bot API, enables automatic sending of incoming updates to an http(s) endpoint as a json payload. Custom certificates are supported, too. This method also calls the disableGetUpdates method automatically

* deleteWebHook - Deletes the webhook

* getWebHookInfo - Gets info about the set webhook

* getUpdates - This method accepts an array of options as the first parameter, and returns an array of updates (an array containing the update id and an object of type [Update](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/types/Update.html)). 

* getChat - Exactly the same usage and response as the getChat method of the main pwrtelegram API

A lot of other methods are supported, to see a full list [click here](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/).


### Sending text buttons in inline keyboards and text mentions for users without a user id

Simply call the sendMessage method with the mtproto parameter set to true.

Inline keyboards with only the text field will be interpreted as text buttons and when the user will press that button the specified text will be sent in the chat, just like for normal keyboards.

To send text mentions use markdown or html links with the following syntax for the url: `mention:userid` or `mention:@username`.  That will send a text mention with the text you specified in the markup mentioning the user you specified.  

Please note that bot API object conversion isn't 100% ready, so any message you've replied to won't be shown.  


### Getting mtproto updates

*NEW*

To can fetch any mtproto update, such as name changes, typing notifications, changes of the online status, and so on, call the enableGetMTProtoUpdates method as the bot, and then fetch updates using the getMtprotoUpdates method.

To disable mtproto update fetching run the disableGetMtprotoUpdates method.

You can also set a webhook for mtproto updates, using the setmtprotowebhook method (deletemtprotowebhook unsets it, getmtprotowebhookinfo gets info about the webhook).  


### Uploading files with the mtproto api

To upload a file call the upload method - it Uploads the file uploaded using POST as the `file` parameter to telegram, returns an [InputFile](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/types/InputFile.html) object that must be used to generate an [InputMedia](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/types/InputMedia.html) object, that can be later sent using the [sendmedia method](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs/methods/messages_sendMedia.html).


### getChatByFile

Use this method to obtain info about the user that uploaded a certain file based on the file's file id. Works with stickers (the creator of the sticker pack is shown) and anonymous channel media too. Works only with file ids created between November 2016 and January 2017.  


| Parameters           	| Type                                                                           	| Required 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                  	|

On success, the following object is returned:

| Name           	| Type                                                                           	| Required 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                  	|

### madeline

Calls an MTProto method using MadelineProto, for a full list of methods see [here](https://daniil.it/MadelineProto/API_docs).  

This method accepts the method to call as the method parameter, and the parameters as a json array in the params parameter.


### getChat

The usage of this method is exactly the same as in the official API except that it supports using usernames of normal users and bots (as every other pwrtelegram method) and returns some additional info like the real_first_name, real_last_name, participants_count, admins_count, kicked_count, description, online (boolean specifying if the user is online), date (last time user was online), the bio and a lot of other info!

### getUpdates and webhook requests.

The response of these requests will be passed trough a piece of code that will filter out messages from @pwrtelegramapi.

### getFile requests.

The PWRTelegram API will then return a [File](https://core.telegram.org/bots/API#file) object.   
You must use the following anonymous url to download the file: ```https://storage.pwrtelegram.xyz/<file_path>``` (or ```https://deepstorage.pwrtelegram.xyz/<file_path>``` for deep telegram bots).

The anonymous download URL will be in one of the following formats:  
```
https://storage.pwrtelegram.xyz/botusername/filename.ext
https://deepstorage.pwrtelegram.xyz/botusername/filename.ext
```  
This way you will be able to safely share the download URL without exposing your bot's token.  


### sendDocument, sendPhoto, sendVideo, sendAudio, sendVoice, sendSticker requests.  

All of the above requests will be processed using the PWRTelegram API.  

The usage of these methods is exactly the same as in the official Telegram BOT API, except that if the request contains a file URL instead of the document (or photo, etc) the file will be downloaded and sent with the given parameters.

The same will happen if you send a file ID that links to a file which type is different from the one specified in the URL or if you also provide a file name along with the file ID.

The PWRTelegram API will automagically obtain the metadata of the provided file/URL and send it along with the file itself (only if it isn't already present in the request).

This is the metadata that will be obtained and sent: 

* Video: width, height and duration as width, height and duration

* Audio: track name, author, duration as title, author, duration

* Voice: duration as duration  


You can also provide a ```file_name``` parameter containing the name of the file to be sent (this is useful when sending files from a URL). If this parameter is set the PWRTelegram API will rename the file/URL you sent and resend the file with the new file name.  



### sendFile

Use this method to send any file/URL/file ID. This method will automagically recognize the type of file/URL uploaded and send it using the correct telegram method. It will also automagically read file metadata and attach it to the request (only if it isn't already provided in the request). On success, the sent Message is returned.

This is the metadata that will be obtained and sent (only if not present in the request) along with the file:

* Video: width, height and duration as width, height and duration

* Audio: track name, author, duration as title, author, duration

* Voice: duration as duration

### uploadFile, uploadDocument, uploadAudio, uploadVideo, uploadVoice, uploadPhoto, uploadSticker

These methods can be used to upload files to telegram without sending them to a particular user. Their usage is exactly the same as for their sendMethod counterparts, except that the chat_id, disable_notification, reply_to_message_id, reply_markup parameters will be ignored.  

On success, they will return a json array containing the following elements:

* ok => true

* result =>

 * file_id => Uploaded file id

 * file_type => Uploaded file type

 * file_size => Uploaded file size

Otherwise the error is returned.


### deleteMessages

Use this method to delete any messages sent by the bot or by any user in any group or private char.  
On success, if the message is deleted by the bot, a json array is returned with the following values:

* ok => true

### You can use both getupdates and webhooks to get updates

Only remember that you will have to repeat the setwebhook request to enable proxying trough the PWRTelegram API.

### answerInlineQuery

The usage of this method is exactly the same as in the official telegram bot api, except that you can provide URLs to files bigger than 5 megabytes and you can set the file type to ```file``` to enable automatical type and metadata recognition.

You can also upload files using via POST: you just have to upload the files with parameter name equal to ```inline_file0``` where 0 is the number of the file. The number has to be equal to the array index of the InlineQueryResult that will feature that file. The type_url field of that InlineQueryResult must also be empty.

Please note that it's better to upload the big files using the upload methods and store the file ids instead of uploading them directly using the answerInlineQuery method.
